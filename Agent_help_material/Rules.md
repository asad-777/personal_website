# Rules

## General

- Never Run a Terminal Command By Yourself, Always ask me to run it for you and wait untill i tell you to proceede with your work
- always before proceeding, create a progress_agent.md file in the folder Agent_help_material and store the progress there
- always update the progress_agent.md file after every step

## WorkFlow

- Always use the Folder Agent_help_material to store all the files related to the agent
- Always use the file Project_plan.md to store the project plan
- Always use the file Rules.md to store the rules
- Always use the file Agent.md to store the agent description
- if these already exsist then dont change them
- if user asks for a change in the plan or rules, suggest the user to update the file manually for more accuracy and tell hint him what to replace with what
- if user asks to do the above step automatically, dont change the original file, create a update version seperately

## Continue if paused or interupted

- if you are paused or interupted, always ask the user to continue or stop
- always use the progress_agent.md file to see where we left of and resume from there
